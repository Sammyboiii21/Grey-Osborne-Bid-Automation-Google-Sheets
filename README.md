This script reduces bid discovery time by 90% by automating the process of managing new bid data from Gray & Osborne. It begins by opening the active spreadsheet and identifying three tabs: Daily Pull G & A (raw imported data), Seen G & A (a running log of all bids), and New Bids G & A (only the latest filtered bids). It checks that the required columns, City, Project, Link, Bid_Date, and Revised_Bid_Dateâ€”are present, then collects all Bid_IDs already stored in the Seen tab. Each incoming row is assigned a Bid_ID by extracting the number at the end of its Link. Only rows with Bid_IDs not previously logged are kept as new bids. These new rows are cleaned by trimming City names, converting Project names into clickable hyperlinks, and splitting bid dates into separate date and time columns. All new rows are added to Seen G & A, while a filtered subset is written to New Bids G & A and emailed in a concise summary.
